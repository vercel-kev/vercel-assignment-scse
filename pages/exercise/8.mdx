##### 8. A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Hello [Customer name],

Thank you for reaching out to Vercel Support! 

You can achieve this by making use of what is known as a robots.txt file.

The robots.txt file is used to instruct web crawlers not to index your site. 

You can easily create this file in the root of your Next.js project with the following content:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

This tells all web crawlers to not index any pages on your site.

You can use the next.config.js to copy this file to the public directory during the build process if itâ€™s not already there.

```
module.exports = withPlugins([withTM], {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/robots.txt',
        destination: '/public/robots.txt',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  },
});
```

Once you have added the robots.txt file and updated your configuration, deploy your site to Vercel.

Additionally, you can add meta tags to your pages to prevent search engines from indexing them.

You can do this by incorporating this piece of code:
```
<Head><meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" /></Head>
```
If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

We're here to help!

Best regards,
