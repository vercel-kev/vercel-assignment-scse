My response

Dear [Customer's Name],

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling frustrated. 

I completely understand how challenging it can be when things aren't working as expected, especially after spending so much time trying to resolve the issue. 

I'm here to help you get this resolved as quickly as possible.

To provide the best possible assistance, I need to gather some additional information about the issue you're experiencing which I had requested from you earlier in our conversation. 

This will help me pinpoint the root cause and ensure that we address it accurately. 

Once again, I totally understand this situation is frustrating, but please be assured that I'm committed to resolving it as soon as possible. 

Your patience is greatly appreciated, and if you prefer, we can also schedule a call to walk through the issue together step-by-step.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to getting this sorted out for you.

Best regards,
Kevin
