#### 2. What do you want to learn or do more of at work?

Firstly I would like to improve my technical knowledge in the realm of Next.js, since I have had very few chances to work with Next.js in full speed. Working in a senior / leader role is also something of a new space to me and I look forward to keep improving and set an example for all of my teammates and new employees that would onboard in the future.
