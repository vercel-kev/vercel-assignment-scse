##### 5. Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

There are a couple of standard questions that I will have to ask the customer about.

These would be questions like:

* What error messages or logs are you seeing, can you include the full description with supporting screenshots?
* When did the issue start occurring?
* Which version of the framework/technology are you using?
* Have you tried any solutions or workarounds?
* Can you provide additional details regarding your machine, environment setup etc.?

Based on all of these responses that are provided by the customer, I will start my research.

I will look into our knowledge base, community forums of framework (if any), similar tickets in our system, official documentations, AI assistants (chatgpt)

And based on the information I find, I will be able to provide a first response to the customer on starting a troubleshooting measure.
