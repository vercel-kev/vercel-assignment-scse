##### 9. What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

Based off of my experience with Vercel I would assume that deployment related questions would be the most common use case where customers would ask questions about.

##### Common problem fixes:
###### Short term:

The short term solution for these scenarios would be to actively troubleshoot these issues for the customer and to provide clear and concise step by step solutions for the customer.

###### Long term:

Long term solution would be to proactively engage with the customers in a regular basis. 

To provide workshops and training sessions by proactively engaging with them so that misconfigurations don't come up and there's always a basic understanding of how our technology works.

Regularly update the knowledge base and keep customers informed about all the latest updates.
