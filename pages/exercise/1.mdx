#### 1. Rank your most 5 favourite and 5 least favourite support tasks

##### My 5 most favourite tasks of all those listed:

* Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project
    * I believe this is the most interesting and vital part of being a customer support engineer. 
    * Reverse tracking to find the root cause of an issue and to provide that feedback back to the customer is one of the most fulfilling moments as an engineer.
* Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
    * I love creating content and I used to maintain a Youtube channel and an educational Instagram page for Flutter
    * Apart from that this reduces redundancy for the entire support team, and makes it easier to support more and more customers as our customer base grows
* Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel
    * Being an assigned customer support engineer reduces anxiety for the customers
    * This also helps to build a closer relationship with the customer thus improving NPS as a by product
* Write and maintain support articles and docs pages
    * As mentioned for the content creation part, I love creating kb items which will reduce redundancy by a significant margin
    * It gives a great feeling of satisfaction to see how many colleagues / customers / new employees who go through these articles help and save time
* Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
    * This is one of the key areas in which I have succeeded in the past 
    * While this would usually be an overwhelming situation, once I set into a rhythm of solving queries, this becomes a great forum of discussion and resolution for customers


##### My 5 least favourite tasks of all those listed:

* Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team 
    * Scheduling and planning time off coverage is one among the most challenging decisions that can take place when you're taking time off as this could potentially include teammates trying to match the lost bandwidth
    * And this would be a tight situation where when if you're an assigned support engineer the delegation of specific accounts needs to be passed on to teammamtes who have adequate context with the customer
* Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders
    * While working towards resolution of incidents is critical, providing difficult updates to external stakeholders is usually a challenging part
* Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent
    * Ticket review sessions can be interesting but at the same time challenging when it comes to dealing with different teammates who's nature of communication might be different
* Help resolve billing issues for customers
    * Billing issues usually do not require much problem solving and would mostly comprise of working through customer emotions. While these could be some of the easy-to-close tickets, they would not be as interesting as technical challenges
* Respond to 25+ support requests via email every day
    * Maintaining a clean inbox and backlog free support volume is a top priority without question but at the same time working towards a number every day will depend on the complexity and the nature of the issues in those specific days
